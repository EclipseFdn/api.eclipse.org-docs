# Eclipse Api RESTful API
Source files for the API should be placed in __src__ folder.

To generate some pretty HTML into the docs folder, run ___grunt build___ at the command line.

To help development, if you run ___grunt serve___, the HTML will be accessible from http://localhost:8080/index.html 

When you same one of the source files, this page will automatically refresh.
